//THIS IS BOOKISH LANGUAGE
RECURSION  FUNCTION CALLING ITSELF
EK KO PEN DIYA USNE MUJHE HE DE DIYA
NOW

//HUMHE KAISE SAMAJNA HAI CODE KO
BIG/COMPLEX PROBLEM KA SOLUTION DEPEND ON SAME TYPE OF CHOTTI PROBLEM THE  IT IS CALLED RECURSION..
EX- 2^N
2^4=2*2*2*2
=2*2^3
2^N=2*2^N-1
F(N)=2*F(N-1)

EXAMPLE FACTORIAL
5! =5*4!
N!=N*(N-1)!
F(N)=N*F(N-1) 

SO 5!=5*4!
=4!=4*3!;
3!=3*2!;
2!=2*1!;
1!=1*0!;
0!=KYU NIKLNA HAI 0! =ZERO HI HOTA HAI
HERE COMES THE BASE CASE WE AT THE END TO STOP IT WE USE BASE CASE
2^4=2*2^3
2^3=2*2^2
2^2=2*2^1
2^1=2*2^0=2*1
YE TO HUMKO PATA HI HAUI KI 2^0 1 HOT HAI
TO BASE CASE USE KAR SKTE HAI
YAHI PE RUK JAYE GYA AND BASE CASE WILL BE USED
Recursion what need?
Base case –jisse ki runk jaye
BASE CASE KO RETUERN KARNA ZARURUI HAI 
Recursive realtion chaiye jiise ki ek kam hum kar le aur sb recursion kare

//processing wala part 3 part ho skte haub 
//like we wqant to store someting orr count something 

notes
Any function which calls itself is called
 recursion. A recursive method solves a 
 problem by calling a copy of itself to 
 work on a smaller problem. Each time a 
 function calls itself with a slightly 
 simpler version of the original problem. 
 This sequence of smaller problems must 
 eventually converge on a base case.

 a case solve karn ahi baki recursion kar de gyo
 1 step kar lo 
baki recursion kar le GYA
//base case use kar lea jisserki ruk jaye wo
